# Research Gap

## Title
Finite-sample reliability of treatment effect estimation under informative outcome missingness in pragmatic clinical datasets.

## Why this is a gap
Many applied medical analyses still rely on complete-case analysis or standard multiple imputation under MAR assumptions. In practice, outcome missingness is often MNAR-like (related to latent disease severity), and models may also be mildly misspecified.

The under-explored practical question is:

> In realistic finite samples (n≈300–1000), how robust are common estimators (Complete Case, MI-MAR proxy, IPW, Doubly Robust AIPW) to informative missingness and mild misspecification?

## Objective
Quantify bias, RMSE, confidence interval coverage, and type-I error across missingness severities and model misspecification settings.

## Clinical framing
Synthetic two-arm comparative-effectiveness setting with binary endpoint (e.g., clinical remission at follow-up).
